##Backend Sprint 4
This Go program implements a simple web application that allows users to register new accounts and log in with existing ones. It uses a MySQL database to store user information, including usernames and bcrypt-hashed passwords.

The program consists of four main functions: loginHandler, loginAuthHandler, registerHandler, and registerAuthHandler. These functions handle the different parts of the login and registration process.

When a user visits the /login URL, the loginHandler function serves them a login form using a pre-defined HTML template. The loginAuthHandler function is then called when the form is submitted. It retrieves the username and password entered by the user, and checks them against the corresponding values in the database. If the login credentials are valid, the function redirects the user to a different URL; otherwise, it displays an error message and shows the login form again.

Similarly, the registerHandler function serves a registration form to users visiting the /register URL. The form requires the user to enter a username and password, which are then checked against a series of validation criteria in the registerAuthHandler function. These include length, complexity, and uniqueness requirements for both the username and password. If the criteria are met, the function generates a bcrypt hash of the password and stores the new user's information in the database. If there are any errors during this process, an error message is displayed to the user.

The program listens for incoming HTTP requests on port 8080 of the localhost address, and uses the http package to handle them. It also uses the template package to render HTML templates for the different pages, and the golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt package to generate and verify password hashes.

Overall, this program provides a basic framework for user authentication and account management, and could be extended or customized to meet the needs of different applications or services.
