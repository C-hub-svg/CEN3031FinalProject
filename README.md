## Project Description
A centralized marketplace for online clothes shopping. Instead of going to each individual store's website, users would be able to input their favorite stores and see multiple store's products on one site.  
## User Stories
1. As a fianc√©e, I need a floor-length white dress, so that I can adhere to tradition. 
2. As a recently-paid person, I want to buy new clothes, so that I look nice. 
3. As a newly-employed person, I need business clothes, so that I can adhere to the dress code. 
4. As a music lover, I want to buy the hat I saw in a music video, so that I can emulate my favorite artists.
