## Project Description
A centralized marketplace for online clothes shopping. Instead of going to each individual store's website, users would be able to input their favorite stores and see multiple store's products on one site.  
## How to run the main.go
In the terminal, use the commands:
  go run main.go
From there you can go to
  http://localhost:8080/register
  - to register an account, if you have one already registered go to the page.
  http://localhost:8080/login
  - login using credentials and you will be redirected to the front end.
